phpUnderControl is an addon application for the continuous integration tool
`CruiseControl`__, which integrates some of the best PHP development tools.
This project aims to make your first steps with CruiseControl and `PHP`__ as
easy as possible. Therefore phpUnderControl comes with a command line tool
that performs all modifications to an existing CruiseControl installation.

Integrated tools
================

- Testing and software metrics

  `PHPUnit`__ is the most popular xUnit implementation for PHP that provides a
  framework for automated software tests. Except the pure test automation PHPUnit 
  contains a rich set of features like `Code Coverage`__, `Project Mess Detection`__
  and `Software Metrics`__. To visualize the generated XML reports phpUnderControl
  comes with a set of XSL stylesheets that prepare the output for CruiseControl.

- Documentation

  phpUnderControl uses the most common documentation tool for PHP projects,
  `PhpDocumentor`__, to generate an up to date documentation of the software
  on every build cycle.  Therefore the developers will always get the latest
  API documentation of their project. Additionally phpUnderControl extracts the
  documentation violations found by the PhpDocumentor and visualizes these as
  an additional quality report in the user interface and the project time line
  of documentation violations.

- Coding Standards

  With the package `PHP_CodeSniffer`__ the `PEAR project`__ gave PHP
  developers a very useful tool to detect coding standard violations in a
  project. Since `version 1.0.0RC3`__ it has native support for the
  `Checkstyle`__ XML format that can be visualized by CruiseControl.
  PHP_CodeSniffer comes with a variety of pre defined coding standards like
  PEAR and ZEND but due to its modular structure you can easily implement a
  custom rule set or extend one of the pre defined sets.  This development
  tool assures that the whole project code will remain clean and consistent.
