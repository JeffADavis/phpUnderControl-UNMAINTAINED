  exists. (done)

- Integrate the `javascript test tool crosscheck`__ mentioned by `Lars in his Blog`__.
  crosscheck is a javascript test environment that is written in java and simulates
  different browsers, so that you can test your code without an installed version.
  (skipped, to special for my own needs, but still a cool tool)
